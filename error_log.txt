Okay, I see you're working on reversing a list in-place! That's a good challenge. I noticed your current code just prints `list` (which might cause an error since `list` is a built-in type). Also, the `pass` statement means the function doesn't actually do anything yet. Let's start with the core idea. To reverse a list in-place, you'll want to swap elements from the beginning and the end of the list, working your way towards the middle. Here are some questions to get you thinking: 1. **How can you access elements at the beginning and end of the list simultaneously?** Think about using indices. 2. **How do you swap two elements in a list?** (e.g., how would you swap the elements at index `i` and index `j` in `lst`?) 3. **How do you determine when you've reached the middle of the list and should stop swapping?** Think about the relationship between the indices you're using. I recommend focusing on these points. Let me know how you want to proceed, and I'll give you more specific guidance!
